# BodyCalculator
This is a body calculator that I made with Python, it will tell you a couple of things:

BMI 
METABOLISM SCORE,
Some things you can overdose on, In grams:
Adderall
Caffeine
Table Salt
IBuprofen

This started off as being programmed in Python but I remade it in C++ for those of you who like that more.


This was honestly a project I made for fun I hope you enjoy and maybe even add to it!
